On the example of the Belogorsk sundial, a method is described for\ndetermining the accuracy of time measurement using an inverted analemmatic\nsundial, in which cup marks are used as hour markers. The obtained value of the\naccuracy of time measurement with the help of the Belogorsk sundial is 5 - 6\nminutes and is quite good for a measuring instrument of the Bronze Age, and is\nalso higher than the accuracy of time measurement with the help of a water\nclock. As a result, it is concluded that the hypothesis is confirmed that the\ninvention of the sundial was associated with the need to improve the accuracy\nof time measurement using a water clock."}
