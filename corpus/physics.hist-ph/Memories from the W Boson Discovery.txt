The bold\ndecision to convert its most powerful, and only recently inaugurated, proton\naccelerator to a proton-antiproton collider led to the discovery of the W and Z\nbosons -- mediators of the weak interaction -- in a record time, at the\nexperiments UA1 and UA2. The decisive roles of Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der\nMeer, who received the 1984 Nobel Prize for physics, are underlined."}
