{"title": "On relativistic temperature", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00354v1", "entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00354v1", "published": "07/01/23", "text": "I revisit the long-running controversy as to the transformation properties of\ntemperature under Lorentz transformations, and argue that, contrary to\nwidespread views in some parts of the literature, `relativistic thermodynamics'\nshould not be understood as a generalization to relativistic physics of an\ninitially non-relativistic theory but as an application of a general\nthermodynamic framework, neutral as to its spacetime setting, to the specific\ncase of relativity. More specifically, I observe that the general framework of\nequilibrium thermodynamics incorporates arbitrary conserved quantities in\naddition to energy and that when that framework is applied to systems in which\nmomentum is conserved and can be transferred between systems, it gives rise to\nan unambiguous result as to the thermodynamics of moving (including\nrelativistically moving) systems. This leads to an equally unambiguous\nprediction as to how thermodynamic temperature transforms under Lorentz\ntransformations (an answer coinciding with Einstein's, and Planck's, original\nresults.) That said, one can identify within this framework other quantities\nwhich play a temperature-like role and have different transformation\nproperties; at some level it is a matter of convention and semantics which is\n`the' temperature. I conclude with some brief remarks about the situation in\ngeneral relativity."}
