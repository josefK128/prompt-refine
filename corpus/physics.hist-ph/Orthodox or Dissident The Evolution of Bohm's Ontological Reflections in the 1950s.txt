{"title": "Orthodox or Dissident The Evolution of Bohm's Ontological Reflections in the 1950s", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06142v1", "entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06142v1", "published": "07/12/23", "text": "David Bohm has often been considered unable to understand the meaning of the\nquantum revolution and to embrace its radical metaphysical implications.\nSimilarly, his pilot-wave theory was negatively portrayed as an attempt to\nrestore a classical and deterministic worldview. Against this background, the\naim of this paper is twofold: in the first place, it will be argued that the\naccusations of dogmatism advanced by several eminent physicists contra Bohm are\nscientifically unfounded, showing a biased understanding of his works.\nReferring to this, two case studies will be discussed: the Bohm-Pauli\ncorrespondence, and the difficult relationship between Bohm and Leon Rosenfeld,\na fervent supporter of Bohr's philosophy of quantum mechanics. As the reader\nwill see, both examples clearly indicate that the opposition against the\npilot-wave approach was for the most part not based on scientific grounds. In\nthe second place, I will reconstruct and analyze the evolution of Bohm's\nphilosophical reflections about ontology, scientific realism and pluralism\nstudying private correspondences as well as his main works in the fifties\nculminated in the book \"Causality and Chance in Modern Physics\". Underlining\nthe originality of Bohm's thoughts, it will be concluded that his perspective\ncan be characterized a form of local realism."}
