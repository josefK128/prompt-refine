{"title": "The Ergodic Hypothesis- A Typicality Statement", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05166v1", "entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05166v1", "published": "07/11/23", "text": "This paper analyzes the ergodic hypothesis in the context of Boltzmann's late\nwork in statistical mechanics, where Boltzmann lays the foundations for what is\ntoday known as the typicality account. I argue that, based on the concepts of\nstationarity (of the measure) and typicality (of the equilibrium state), the\nergodic hypothesis, as an idealization, is a consequence rather than an\nassumption of Boltzmann's approach. More precisely, it can be shown that every\nsystem with a stationary measure and an equilibrium state (be it a state of\noverwhelming phase space or time average) behaves essentially as if it were\nergodic. I claim that Boltzmann was aware of this fact as it grounds both his\nnotion of equilibrium, relating it to the thermodynamic notion of equilibrium,\nand his estimate of the fluctuation rates."}
