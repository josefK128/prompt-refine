{"title": "Unveiling the Connection- ER bridges and EPR in the work of Einstein", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05548v1", "entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05548v1", "published": "07/09/23", "text": "This paper explores the ER bridges theory and its relationship with quantum\nphenomena. An argument can be made that the ER bridges theory does not\nexplicitly address quantum phenomena and implies that Einstein intended to\ndifferentiate between individual particles within the ER bridges theory and the\nsystems involved in the EPR paradox. However, this paper contends that Einstein\nheld a distinct viewpoint. He endeavored to elucidate quantum characteristics\nby modifying general relativity, aiming to incorporate concepts such as local\nrealism, separability, causality, and determinism, without relying on the\nprinciples of quantum mechanics. He proposed representing elementary particles\nusing parallel ER bridges connecting two flat sheets to achieve this."}
