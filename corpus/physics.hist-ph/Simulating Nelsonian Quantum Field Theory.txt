{"title": "Simulating Nelsonian Quantum Field Theory", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03188v1", "entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03188v1", "published": "07/06/23", "text": "We describe the picture of physical processes suggested by Edward Nelson's\nstochastic mechanics when generalized to quantum field theory, after an\nintroductory review of his theory applied to the hydrogen atom. By performing\nnumerical simulations of the relevant stochastic processes, we observe that\nNelson's theory provides an intuitive account of how particles can arise from\nan underlying field ``beable'' -- to use a phrase of John S. Bell -- in the\ncase of free field theory, regularized on a lattice. We then argue that this\npicture looks qualitatively similar when generalized to interacting scalar\nfield theory. Lastly, we compare the Nelsonian framework to various other\nproposed ontologies for QFT, and remark upon their relative merits in light of\nthe effective field theory paradigm."}
