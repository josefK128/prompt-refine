{"title": "Complexity Heliophysics- A lived and living history of systems and complexity science in Heliophysics", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03287v1", "entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03287v1", "published": "07/06/23", "text": "In this piece we study complexity science in the context of Heliophysics,\ndescribing it not as a discipline, but as a paradigm. In the context of\nHeliophysics, complexity science is the study of a star, interplanetary\nenvironment, magnetosphere, upper and terrestrial atmospheres, and planetary\nsurface as interacting subsystems. Complexity science studies entities in a\nsystem (e.g., electrons in an atom, planets in a solar system, individuals in a\nsociety) and their interactions, and is the nature of what emerges from these\ninteractions. It is a paradigm that employs systems approaches and is\ninherently multi- and cross-scale. Heliophysics processes span at least 15\norders of magnitude in space and another 15 in time, and its reaches go well\nbeyond our own solar system and Earth's space environment to touch planetary,\nexoplanetary, and astrophysical domains. It is an uncommon domain within which\nto explore complexity science.\n  After first outlining the dimensions of complexity science, the review\nproceeds in three epochal parts: 1) A pivotal year in the Complexity\nHeliophysics paradigm: 1996; 2) The transitional years that established\nfoundations of the paradigm (1996-2010); and 3) The emergent literature largely\nbeyond 2010.\n  This review article excavates the lived and living history of complexity\nscience in Heliophysics. The intention is to provide inspiration, help\nresearchers think more coherently about ideas of complexity science in\nHeliophysics, and guide future research. It will be instructive to Heliophysics\nresearchers, but also to any reader interested in or hoping to advance the\nfrontier of systems and complexity science."}
