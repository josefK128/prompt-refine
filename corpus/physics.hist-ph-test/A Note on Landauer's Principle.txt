It is\nshown that the source of the compensating entropy for irreversible physical\nprocesses is due to the irreducible uncertainty attending values of such\nmutually incompatible observables. The relevant irreversibility is argued to be\nthat of quantum measurement rather than erasure of classical memory devices, as\ncommonly assumed."}
