{"title": "Against the nightmare of a mechanically determined universe- Why Bohm was never a Bohmian", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05611v1", "entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05611v1", "published": "07/10/23", "text": "David Bohm has put forward the first deterministic interpretation of quantum\nphysics, and for this he seems to be regarded as a champion of determinism by\nphysicists (both his contemporaries and the supporters of his interpretation,\nthe so-called \"Bohmians\") as well as by historians of physics. The standard\nnarrative is that he underwent a \"conversion\" from being a supporter of Bohr to\nbeing a staunch determinist, due to his interaction with Einstein and his\ncommitment to Marxism. Here we show that Bohm actually upheld with continuity\nthroughout his career some philosophical tenets that included a strong\nrejection of mechanistic determinism. As such, we conclude that Bohm was never\na Bohmian and that his philosophical views have been largely misinterpreted."}
